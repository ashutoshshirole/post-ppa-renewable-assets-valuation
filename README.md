# post-ppa-renewable-assets-valuation
This project presents a data-driven framework for valuing renewable energy assets transitioning from Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to merchant market exposure. The objective is to determine a fair fixed-price ($/MWh) for potential 5-year offtake contracts (2026–2030) that balance expected merchant revenues against risk tolerance (P75).
